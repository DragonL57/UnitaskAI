# Plan: Sub-Agent Iterative Tool Calling

This plan outlines the steps to enable sub-agents to perform multi-round tool usage.

## Phase 1: Sub-Agent Refactor
- [ ] Task: Refactor `src/agents/scheduler.ts` to implement an iterative tool execution loop
- [ ] Task: Refactor `src/agents/researcher.ts` to implement an iterative tool execution loop
- [ ] Task: Update Specialist prompts in `src/prompts/` to support autonomous multi-step reasoning
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Sub-Agent Refactor' (Protocol in workflow.md)
