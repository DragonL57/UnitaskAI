# Plan: Memory Agent as Silent Observer

This plan outlines the steps to implement the autonomous memory evaluation logic.

## Phase 1: Logic Implementation
- [ ] Task: Create `src/prompts/memory.ts` with a system prompt for memory extraction
- [ ] Task: Update `src/agents/memory.ts` to implement `evaluateAndStore` logic using the LLM
- [ ] Task: Update `src/actions/chat.ts` to trigger the Memory Agent for every message
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Logic Implementation' (Protocol in workflow.md)
