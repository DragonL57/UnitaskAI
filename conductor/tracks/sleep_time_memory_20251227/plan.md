# Plan: Sleep-time Compute for Memory Agent

This plan outlines the implementation of iterative, deep-thinking memory consolidation.

## Phase 1: Implementation
- [x] Task: Refactor `src/prompts/memory.ts` with Sleep-time reasoning instructions dbaca33
- [ ] Task: Refactor `src/agents/memory.ts` to implement the `rethink_memory` iterative loop
- [ ] Task: Ensure the `workingMemory` is saved to Vercel Blob only after consolidation
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Implementation' (Protocol in workflow.md)
